This directory must exist and must contain a set of colored screenshots from PCs.
You can get a sample set here: https://s3.amazonaws.com/grayscale-data/screenshots.zip

Download that file and uncompress its contents into this directory.
When that process is done, this directory should contain no subdirectories, only .bmp files.

All of the files should have the same dimensions and should be 24bpp color images.
